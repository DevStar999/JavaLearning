    // Notes -> (*) Definition - Greedy Algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm which follows the problem solving approach
    // of making the locally optimum choice at each step with hope of finding the global optimum.
    // (*) Pros - Simple, easy to implement, run fast
    // (*) Cons - Very often it does not provide a globally optimum solution.
    // (*) Problems on which greedy approach works has 2 properties -
    // a) Greedy-choice property - A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum
    // b) Optimal Substructure - An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to sub-problems
    // (*) Difference from DP - A Greedy Algorithm never reconsiders it's choices unlike DP, also DP is exhaustive and
    // is guaranteed to give a solution to the problem.
